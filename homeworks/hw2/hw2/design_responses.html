					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned about the functionalities of whitespace, as well as common concerns expressed. White space helps guide the user to 
								important information, and allows them to focus on certain things. It also makes the site more aesthetic and visually organized, making it easier to read. 
							In addition, the concerns addressed was that white space is NOT wasted space, and that it does not inconvenience users. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was seeing how white space was emphasized to make the webpages more appealing.
								There were direct comparisons between using and not using white space, which helped visually explain the reasons
							why white space is necessary. The examples were interesting to observing and look at, seeing it from a designers POV as well as a customer's. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> Users will scroll and scroll some more. I promise you. There is this myth that users will not always scroll to see all the content on a page. Thus, some of our stakeholders request that the majority of a pageâ€™s content lives above the fold. </p>
						</li>
