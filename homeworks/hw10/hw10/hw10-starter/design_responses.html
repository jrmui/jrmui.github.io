							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p> I thought it was an interested article that brought to our attention (no pun intended) how attention works! 
								I've touched a bit upon this topic through cognitive science classes here at berkeley, so it hasn't really influenced my opinion on how UX and Psychology go hand in hand.
								Especially since we've read another article about design and how our brains fill in images (eg. gestalt principles) and how certain features on websites are meant to grab our attentions.
								I found the stages of information processing interesting though, how it goes from sensing to perceiving to decision-making to acting.
								Some examples of attention include selective attention and divided attention, both of which are determined by situation and stimuli.
