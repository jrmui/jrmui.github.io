					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned about what color accessibility is. I didn't think about the fact that web-designers incorporate color as a factor to making a website more accessible. For instance, doing things like adding contrast, not relying soley on color, focusing on state contrast, and other actions help promote color accessibility. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> The examples given to create a more color-accessible website was helpful to me in seeing a difference I may have otherwise not noticed. Some things, like adding contrast, seemed like a thing that most people do unconsciously as even for someone who isn't colorblind, the text is hard to identify. However, ensuring that small colored-outlines are accompanied with descriptive texts is something that I may not have picked up on, as color is generally associated with other signals. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> In 2017, The World Health Organization estimated that roughly 217 million people live with some form of moderate to severe vision impairment. That statistic alone is reason enough to design for accessibility. </p>
