							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned a few tips to keep in mind when designing animations. For instance, unless intended, animations should be slow enough so that users notice a change, but quick enough as to not bore them. The optimal animation is between 200 ms and 500 ms. In addition, the time for animations changes depending on the size of the device. Bigger devices could and should have longer transitions/animations than smaller devices.</p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I liked learning about the different animation-related components to designing website animations. For instance, I didn't know about the use of asymmetric curves to make movements more natural and realistic. The way an object moves, in relation to position and time, matters a lot as it draws the users attention to different things. The emergence of an object should be longer to captivate the user. </p>

							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> But do not forget that animation is more of an art than science, so it's better to experiment and test your decisions on users.</p>
