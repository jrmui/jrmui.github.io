        <p>Hi! I'm Jonathan, a freshman studying Data Science from Chicago, IL! When I'm not falling asleep in Wheeler 150, I like spending my time exploring new cities, crocheting, playing badminton, doing escape rooms, and late night walks/car rides. Looking forward to meeting you all soon!</p>

            <li>I learned about different things to keep in mind when desinging a website,
                 including hierachies, content, intent, and audiences. More specifically, 
                 I learned how the concept of hierarchies are used to help guide the user's 
                 focus, and how the remaining fields blend with each other to produce a captivating website.

            <li>The most interesting part to me about the article was seeing how each mobile
                 app was broken down into the components that structured it. It was interesting 
                 observing how different features were placed in different areas on the app's 
                 display, giving each one different sizes and highlights to emphasize different 
                 meanings.
            </li>
            <li>You develop your design eye by thinking as if you were the designer of a product. Open an app you use often and resist the urge to start scrolling through content. Instead, I want you to actively focus on the screen in front of you.</li>
