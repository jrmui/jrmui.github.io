						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned what typography is! It refers to the style and appearance of text, and has many different components that must be taken into account in order to appeal to consumers / it's audience. These featuers include considering the medium's purpose, background designs, audience, other font selections, sizing, and colors. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article was seeing how the golden ratio could be incorporated into something like this. I never considered using the golden ratio to help determine font sizes and assign certain headings sizes based off of that. I also found it interseting that there were actual methods to determine font sizing, which I never considered before. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> Choose fonts that are conventional and easy to read. Avoid highly decorative fonts in favor of simple and practical fonts. Also, be mindful of the purpose of a font. </p>
						</li>
